# coreEntropy_neighborIFS
The up-to-date and documented code for my research on the connection between the Mandelbrot set and the Thurston set.

[THEORY SLIDES](https://slides.com/silvas/qsconjcoreentropy)

## TODOs :
- [ ] write python code to calculate the Core Entropy
- [ ] refactor the KneadToRat function
- [ ] create python modules from the code in the jupyter notebooks
- [ ] make some example on how to use this code
- [ ] write down the theory
- [ ] figure out another way to draw graphs other than Gephi
- [ ] write a recursive function that erases vertices with out degree equal to 0.
- [ ] import Mathematica notebooks (?)
