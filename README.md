# coreEntropy_neighborIFS
The up-to-date and documented code for my research on the connection between the Mandelbrot set and the Thurston set.

## TODOs :
    - [ ] refactor the KneadToRat function
    - [ ] create python modules from the code in the jupyter notebooks
    - [ ] make some example on how to use this code
    - [ ] write down the theory
    - [ ] figure out another way to draw graphs other than Gephi
    - [ ] import Mathematica notebooks (?)
